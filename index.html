							<h1>Harrison's Story</h1>
							<p class="major">
							Howdy! <br />
							My name is Harrison Ooi and I was born and raised in Tennessee. I love to cook, workout, hang-out with my fiance and also finding 
							the beauty in the chaos of numbers through data science.  	
							 <br> <br>
							In college, I studied Transportation Engineering. However, during those 4 years, I decided to slightly shift my career path. 
							This is because in the summer of 2019, I interned as a project engineer at <a href="https://www.pepsico.com/">PepsiCo</a>. 
							Here I saw the bridge between data science and its application to the community. 
							In those 3 months, my life changed. I decided to pivot my career towards the digital frontier.
							<br>
							<br>
							After countless number of all-nighters, I now passionately work as a data science engineer at  <a href="https://us.pg.com/">Procter and Gamble</a>. Where everyday,
							I get to apply my skills towards making sound operational and business decisions for not just the company but for the community as well. <br>
